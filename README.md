Enhancing Microbial Predator-Prey Detection with Network and Trait-Based Analyses
================

This is a collection of the scripts detailing the methods of metabarcoding data analyses used for the paper in process authored by Cristina Martínez Rendón, Christina Braun, Maria Kappelsberger, Jens Boy, Angélica Casanova-Katny, Karin Glaser, and Kenneth Dumack.

After the release of the publication, the raw sequencing data will be available to download in [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1144814), under the accession numbers SAMN43044305, SAMN43044306, and SAMN43044307. The three original OTU tables with taxonomic annotation are available in the folder [1_Data](1_Data), where you can also access the metadata and data of the chemical edaphic parameters. Intermadiate files and results can be obtained by running the scripts, while the figures produced are given at the end of each script. 

It should be noted that some of the figure parameters may vary somewhat after reanalysis owing to the random iterative nature of certain analyses (such rarefaction, beta diversity, and PCoA), but the fundamental conclusions will largely stay the same.
